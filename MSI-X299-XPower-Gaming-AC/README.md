# X299-System-SSDTs

## Instructions

This X299 System SSDT Github repository constitutes a set of motherboard and PCIe-Slot specific system SSDTs for the ASUS Prime X299 Deluxe. Users of different motherboards and/or different PCIe-Slot populations have to adopt at least the ACPI path and ACPI replacments implemented in each specfic file.

How to do so, is explained wihtin this small and basic guideline:
http://kgp-hackintosh-corner.com/how-to-create-or-modify-a-simple-system-ssdt-aml-by-means-of-dsdt-and-ioreg-acpi-information

In general it is recommended to directly use or modify/adopt the ready-to-use AML files under "Distribution".

However it is also possible to downlaod a DSL version of the respective AML files under "Sources"
and to subseqeuntly execute the `Compile.command` from terminal; However, compilation errors (DSL to AML conversion errors) induced by the MaciASL compiler cannot be excluded in this case.
